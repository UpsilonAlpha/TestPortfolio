# Open Source Government
<br/><br/>

Ahh Photoshop. A name so popular that it got denominalized - turned into a verb. However, look at the price and you can see that it’s steep. Meanwhile GIMP a piece of software that’s just as good if not better in some respects is completely free.
<br/>

This is the magic of open source software, which essentially means code that anyone can read and modify. It’s scarily effective. In the past few years most of the applications I use have shifted to becoming open source. Why? Because I think it’s better.
<br/>

Let me throw some names at you, Firefox, VLC media player, Audacity. If you were alive anywhere around the time I was, this should give you a feeling of slight nostalgia. These pieces of software look old, feel old to use and were probably used by your parents. They also have a reputation of being well… crappier. They fell out of popularity slightly as flashier things took their place, but now open source is making a comeback with more and more big companies, in particular Google, leaning into making more of their products free to the public.
<br/>

Now if you ask Adobe, software like photoshop is a product to be kept and tightly guarded with strict licensing. Meanwhile the internet has a sea of alternatives for free which perform almost as good. You as the consumer have to choose. We’ve been conditioned to think that expensive is better because well, usually it is. Here however, we have software created volunteers in their spare time competing with something made by a team of professionals from a company rolling in dough. That’s amazing.
<br/>

So, what does this have to do with Government? Well, when most pepole think of Government they see big buildings, black suits, and state secrets. They’re a big force that takes your tax money and determine large aspects of your life. In reality, government isn’t monolithic, it’s just people trying to do what’s best for their constituents (but let’s face it, most likely also themselves). They have ideas, like the rest of us and want to see those ideas realized.
<br/>

Governing is simply a way to get power and despite the common addage I don’t think that power is inherently bad. However, government power is often inefficient, slow and doesn’t do what it’s trying to do. This leads to a whole lot of people suffering. On top of this people don’t even know what laws there are without taking an expensive professional law degree. Even then, you still won't be able to know every single law off by heart.
<br/>

The only laws people do know are the ones that affect us. You probably know the fine for speeding, but do you know the fine for sleeping on a public bench? Probably not. Yet every day we ask people with no relation to specific situations to make decisions about said situations. Sure some person born and raised in the big city might be able to predict how a farming subsidy will affect potato exports, but how do they know how it affects the farmers?
<br/>

There’s a lot of thought that goes into policy of course, I’m not saying people in charge don’t do research, just that often, it’s inefficient. Most people don’t even *know* what they want until a decision is made, then suddenly everyone hates it.
<br/>

This is a problem with any form of 'top down' control. Take for example the plight of Digg, which was a widely used website filled with news and videos. Following a very unpopular UI change thousands of people switched to this new website called ‘Reddit’. You may have heard of it. Meanwhile Digg is still there, now just another trashy news site. The point here is that often a decision made by few people, even with good intentions has the potential to fail the needs of everyone else.
<br/>

However law is similar to code. It's just for people instead of computers. It’s the rules we put in place to make sure society functions smoothly. Money is like electricity that causes an economy to move, and those in power allocate money to things in an attempt to appease those who vote for them. We the people, are a very big and very indecisive customer. As anyone working in web development would know, this is like a nightmare. So, pretend with me for a second and imagine lawmakers as very unfortunate programmers in the position of catering to a whole diverse nation of people.
<br/>

They see a societal issue; they make a change to the code to fix that issue. If there’s a bug, some sort of loophole or flaw in the code, they’ll know five years down the line when people suffer enough to protest and bring it to attention. It’s hard enough to test code for normal programmers who can recieve feedback immediately, so how do we expect policy makers to be effective?
<br/>

That’s bad programming. Gee, it’d sure be nice if there was a way to make governmental decisions without accidentally harming a bunch of people…
<br/>

Enter, open source software. Let’s say we have a person, Gary. Gary is a teen who works at a restaurant and doesn’t like that there’s a restriction on the amount people under the age of 18 can work. This is because he expressed interest to take more hours during the holidays, but his boss had to turn him down because it was illegal. Gary wanted to earn some extra cash on his break, so he thinks that the restriction should be changed during holiday periods to reflect the lack of school taking up time.
<br/>

Gary’s options are either: Wait until he turns 18 then vote for a person who might change the law or might not, start a niche petition and hope it gets noticed (unlikely), or break the law. This is a very inconsequential example of course; Gary could just live with the annoyance, but this example can apply to other more important legislation. So, what can we do to make this system better?
<br/>

A great first step would be to have an open online repository of laws and regulations that anyone can go through. Anyone could then change these laws and submit a request. A committee of government officials (similar to a traditional senate) can then sort through these changes and approve those that are a significant improvement. Would Gary’s change get approved? Maybe, it’s not really an *amazing* change. However the point is that it’s getting read and getting heard. This is essentially a government bill. However, while submitting a bill is a lengthy and bureaucratic process, small changes and amendments like this shouldn’t have to be.
<br/>

If you think this could be dangerous, such as harmful laws slipping past the verification process due to a corrupt or bored official, you’d be right. This is why we need two more systems. Firstly, a weighting on each law considering how many people that it impacts. This determines the level of scrutiny that the bill is put through. So, Gary’s law would probably be approved by just a single committee, but other laws would go through more revisions. Second would be a simple polling system which shows which bills the public support the most.
<br/>

In Linux, a very popular operating system, 10000 lines of code are added, 5000 lines are changed and 8000 are removed every day. The entire thing changes 9 times an hour. Yet somehow it is also the most secure operating system as it’s constantly being reviewed and checked for issues by a large community of stakeholders. By having a method for members of the public to quickly create and change bills we can change government from an inefficient mess that is rigid and inflexible to an inefficient mess that we can try to improve.
<br/>

The end goal is to simply have government officials act as administrators who are well trained enough to recognize the effects of passing certain bills and not being the ones to draft laws themselves. This lets us minimize selfish interests and corruption that government is rife with. If the law is read over and actively managed by those it affects most it’ll be even harder to cause harm. 
<br/>

Obviously this is easier said than done, and such a radical change will take time, but I believe that an ideal governing system is one that is iterable, transparent and scientific. Making the keys to power more accessible to the public is one step towards that future.
