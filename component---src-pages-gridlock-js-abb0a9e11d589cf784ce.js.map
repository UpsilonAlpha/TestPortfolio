However there didn't seem to be any local multiplayer options online so I decided to make my own.</p>\r\n        <p>However, as shown by the <Link style={linkStyles} to=\"https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far\">AlphaGo</Link> project, this game is far more complicated than it looks. Unlike chess there is a near infite number of ways to capture enemy pieces. Also, there weren't any online tutorials like were for chess.</p>\r\n        <p>So I was on my own when starting to program this game. That was until I discovered an article on the <Link style={linkStyles} to=\"https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/flood-fill-algorithm/tutorial/\">floodfill algorithm</Link>. This algorithm has a few uses in image processing and pathfinding but I decided to adapt it for the game.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Pieces are captured when they are fully encircled by enemy pieces. However despite this simple premise, there were many literal edge cases. It took me long hours at the keyboard to discover a way to adapt the algorithm so it would work on the sides of the board.</p>\r\n        <p>After finally completing a functioning CLI prototype, I decided migrated my code to create a native Windows application with a far more compelling UI. Finally! I could play against friends and share the app with others.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Making this app taught me perseverance in the face of complex technical issues, as well as the importance of prototypes! This knowledge would be vital when it came to developing my first mobile game Nucleogenesis.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Gridlock"],"names":["pageStyles","color","background","fontFamily","height","linkStyles","textDecoration","centerDiv","margin","padding","style","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
