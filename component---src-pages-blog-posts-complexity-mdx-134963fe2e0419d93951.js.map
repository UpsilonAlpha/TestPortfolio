This leads to two answers: either “Life has no meaning.” or more optimistically “Life has whatever meaning you give it.”`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`How are you supposed to give life a meaning? Nobody knows. Figure it out.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`So that’s what I set out to do.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What do we want?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`I first settled on hedonism. If life has no meaning then I would just do what made me happy.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Unfortunately, this isn’t without it’s flaws. If you wanted to maximise pleasure then the most logical way to do so is to create a ‘pleasure machine’.  This hypothetical machine will allow you to experience bliss forever, the only thing you have to give up is your current reality for a new far better reality.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Yet despite being logical, this idea doesn’t sit well with most people. This hints that despite being such a driving force for much of our life, pleasure isn’t the end goal. Chasing pleasure is meaningless because pleasure is a control system that evolved to get you to survive and pass your genes on.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Why do we want it?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`So we’re back to square one. Life has no meaning. At least until we look further.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Why do living things want to survive and pass their genes on? Unfortunately the most scientifically accepted answer is that it’s a coincidence. Our genetic material – DNA – has two fundamental properties. It replicates, and it mutates.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Some mutations help it replicate better which leads to… you guessed it! More of that DNA. Evolution! That’s what sets us apart from other chemical reactions. We adapt and keep on going. This, according to science, is very weird.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Why are we special?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`So that’s the meaning of life. The purpose of every living organism. Preserve your genetic code and pass it on. Be the best DNA you can be!`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`What? Isn’t that good enough for you?`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`If you’re still reading I guess not. See there’s an even more fundamental way in which life affects the universe. It comes down to entropy. Entropy is qualitatively described as the level of ‘disorder’ in the universe but it’s more of a mathematical fact. Entropy always increases. When you look at anywhere else in the universe, things are becoming more disordered.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Life however, messes with this rule. Life creates order. From the structure of your bones to the structure of your home, these are not things that would occur without life. We’re very weird.\nOf course life still obey the rules of the universe. Every time we decrease entropy we cause a corresponding increase somewhere else. Life must break down ordered fuel into disordered heat with every action. Yet locally, life defies disorder with it’s mere existence.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Sure may not decrease the entropy of the universe, but we do increase the complexity of it. This local decrease in disorder is the true meaning of life.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What is complexity?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Complexity is a nice catch-all term for our local decrease in disorder. However it’s still annoyingly vague. It’s still a better measure than ‘goodness’ or ‘happiness’, but what does complexity really mean? Well it’s likely you’ve been unconsciously measuring complexity your whole life! `}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Well let’s start with one of the most complex things: humans. Many moral systems will tell you that human life is the most valuable thing. However the only thing that sets us apart from other animals is the complexity of our brains. Human brains are the most complex thing that we know of. We build structures and are capable of reaching other planets. As a result we’re the best bet for life’s complexity to spread across the universe. In most moral systems murder is considered as the worst thing to do and complexity theory supports this.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`However we’re not the ONLY complex thing in the universe. Right now we’re destroying the ecosystems of thousands of other creatures. There’s complexity in all life, however there’s also different levels of complexity. An animal is more complex than a tree which is more complex than a bacterium. This fits in with our current morals, for example killing an animal feels morally worse than killing a bacterium. It also provides a moral argument to prevent habitat destruction that occurs today.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Another important consideration is that short term complexity can often harm future complexity. For example, if we decided to clone someone billions of times it would be terrible! They’d require food and carers, all of which would quickly run out. This would possibly result in many deaths, as well as be a colossal waste of time. Meanwhile if we focused on improving farming and infrastructure we’d be able to support a more diverse set of people for a longer period of time.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`What should we do?`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Our goal as living beings should therefore be to increase complexity. We evolved to this point from single cells, why not continue further? One of the biggest inventions of our time – the internet – is a tool to connect us together. By connecting and cooperating we have created something far better than any of us could alone.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`However, what can an individual do to help increase complexity in the universe? Well first of all we have to conserve the complexity we already have, which involves trying to stop climate change even at a great cost. In the same vein we should try and provide education as well as basic essentials  such as food and water to as many people as possible. It’s a simple formula that allows more people to operate at their full capacity instead of struggling to survive. This in turn means more complex ideas and better technology to solve our problems.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`However, we also need to take steps towards the long-term survival of life. This means self-sustaining colonies on other planets, and eventually further expansion into the universe. In turn, this means more people. More art, more cultures, more joys. More complexity.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","target","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
