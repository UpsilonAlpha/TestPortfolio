That's why I decided to integrate my app with the online flashcard builder <Link style={linkStyles} to=\"https://quizlet.com/latest\">Quizlet</Link>. In order to do this I had to learn three key concepts:</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Make API calls to gather data</li>\r\n            <li>Read and write to JSON files</li>\r\n            <li>Create a gameshow-esque buzzer system</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n        <p>Me and a few other classmates used Quizlet to store flashcards. There's an inherent suspense when using humble learning device which makes it perfect for gamification. As a result I did research to find a quizlet API that allowed me to request decks of flashcards in JSON format.</p>\r\n        <p>I then added functionality to save the flashcard deck to one's computer, allowing users to play offline. Then, when playing I read from the JSON file in order to display questions on screen. Players then had to press a 'buzzer' key to be allowed to answer the question.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>In order to increase the stakes I also made the text scroll across the screen to emulate a gameshow host reading the question out. I also added a timer after each buzzer press in order to answer the question</p>\r\n        <p>This project was fundamental for teaching me how to use APIs and JSON in combination with a native app that can read/write to files. I essentially learned all the skills required to make a fully featured desktop application. This foundation helped me a lot with other projects such as making a discord bot.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Streak\r\n"],"names":["pageStyles","color","background","fontFamily","height","linkStyles","textDecoration","centerDiv","margin","padding","style","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
