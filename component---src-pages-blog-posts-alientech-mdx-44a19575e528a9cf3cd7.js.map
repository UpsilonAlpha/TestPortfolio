However, the most influential technology in our history, is often ignored. In fact, this technology is the foundation of every civilisation in history. It caused everything from the rise of the Mongol empire to the industrial revolution.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`What’s more, we’ve only discovered 14% of this technology to date. The other 86% is now being actively destroyed along with all the potential breakthroughs it could create.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`What is this technology? Other living species.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`When most of us think of technology, something such as ‘domestication’ is not on the list. However it is the primary reason why you have food on your plate and clothes on your back. Most of us hardly need to think about this, despite it being a primary concern for humans for centuries. Yet for something that is so influential, the importance of nature is still often overlooked.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`This is because we don’t actually understand it. The complex machinery of animals and plants are the result of a very complicated emergent process spanning billions of years. It’s ‘alien’ to us.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`For example what we think of as ‘food’ is actually a series of tools and tricks used to ensure a species’ survival. Take for example barley, which disguised itself as wheat to take advantage of our cultivation. All the fruits you’ve eaten are tricks used by plants to spread their seeds. It could be argued that we only exist because plants need us.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`We only knew heavier-than-air flight was possible due to birds. Even now, our best drones can’t function as well as innumerable species of insects. We had the lenses in our eyes long before the camera. Leaves use quantum mechanics to outperform any solar panel in their efficiency. I could go on.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`So many of our greatest achievements comes from the wellspring of inspiration that is nature. Unfortunately the effects of the Anthropocene are wiping out biodiversity around the world and we’re wiping out our largest repository of potential technologies along with it.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Take the axolotl for example. If a human gets their limbs chopped off, that’s that. Not so for the axolotl – a creature that has lots to teach us about cellular regeneration – a literal superpower. Yet there may be only 1000 of them left in their original habitat.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`The blue whale – biggest organism on the planet and famously endangered – cannot get cancer. One of the biggest health problems in humans seems to already have been solved, but it’s rather difficult to study this phenomenon for two reasons. The first is because they’re so large, and the second is because they almost went extinct.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Then there are primates, closest living relatives to humans. Their sleeping and eating habits, their social interactions and their group dynamics have been instrumental in psychological research. Because their DNA is so similar to our own, primates could help us learn more about the human brain, leading to better ways to manage serious mental illnesses. In case you haven’t realised most primates are being wiped out too.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`Yet these are only the species we know of! There’s still 86% of them out there. Aliens with alien tools. We’re destroying them without even realising it.`}</p>\n    <br />\n    <p>{`This is what makes environmentalism worthwhile. Humans aren’t alone on this planet, we’re a small part of a much greater whole. As far as we know, life is rare in the universe, we many never encounter other beings. This is all the more reason to keep the aliens we have now, alive.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","isMDXComponent","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","target","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
