Instead, the market supplies you with everything and you’re essentially ‘voting’ with your money.</p><br/><p>Now this doesn’t work for many reasons, chief among which is the need for social services that apply to everybody. This is includes firefighting, police, healthcare and so on. People need roads to be paved and streetlights to be built so everyone pays a portion of their hard earned cash to the Government.</p><br/><p>However the problem arises when no-one agrees what this money should be spent on. I’m sure you’re familiar. Coming up with a ‘budget’ for a country is no mean feat and is fought over year after year by hundreds of competing interests.</p><br/><p>However, what if instead of paying taxes in one lump sum, you could choose where a portion of your money goes to? A pared back version of this idea would be to present pre-existing sectors of the government that already exist (things like ‘Education’, ‘Transport’ and ‘Healthcare’) then allowing citizens to choose where to put 10% of their taxes.</p><br/><p>That way the government would still control 90% of tax revenue and citizens would be able to support the services they prefer. So for example a parent may choose to give 10% to education while someone with a sick relative may choose to give their 10% to healthcare. The money could then be allocated as it normally would within those sectors.</p><br/><p>This is far more efficient than providing votes for individual politicians and simply hoping they’ll budget in your favour. Even a small amount leverage would make government more likely to follow through with its promises. Government agencies would need to compete for funding from the public, which means catering to what the public likes and justifying their existence. However unlike corporations they would not be beholden to the same limitations due to the absence of a profit motive.</p><br/><p>Government agencies would also have an incentive to be far more transparent. This means that individuals would be more aware of what their money could be doing! As it stands tax revenue is seen as a guarantee to many agencies so any excess spending and inefficiencies are buried under the rug. Having a percentage pay system would let the public decide whether certain things are useful to them, instead of only a few people at the top.</p><br/><p>Increased transparency would be helpful for other causes too, such as activism, as it’s easier to know exactly what our money is and isn’t doing. This makes it easier to campaign for social change which would translate to actual change on the budget! You could even extend this down to individual government projects, almost like how crowdfunding works today.</p><br/><p>Let’s say the government wanted to build a new park. How would it know if people wanted that park? They’d simply make it an option to pick when everyone is doing taxes. If enough people are willing to put their tax dollars towards the park, then it’s worthwhile and should be built! If everyone wants to pay for cancer research instead then that’s what will happen. Being more specific like this shows the people exactly what the government is planning to do so no-one is massively disappointed by a ‘waste’ of tax dollars.</p><br/><p>You could also extend this idea to companies. They already spend millions lobbying government and evading taxes. Why not kill two birds with one stone and let companies choose how to allocate part of the tax they have to pay and make the decisions public. Now suddenly the biggest companies are under immense scrutiny about where they allocate their tax money. </p><br/><p>“Oh, did you hear? BP put its tax money into a new train line that only helps themselves! Boooo.”
“Google just put their tax money into a solar farm! Yayy!”</p><br/><p>Suddenly paying tax is a PR game for corporations that want to stay popular. This means more money going to the things people like. If we ran social programs like compulsory crowdfunding projects not only would those in power get to provide us with choice, but they’d also get important financial signals. Unlike crowdfunding, government could also set limits on the amount of money per project to ensure nothing is over-funded.</p><br/><p>The whole point of Government is to make you pay for things you need but don’t want. From armies to ambulances some things are necessary some of the time. Yet right now you don’t get a clear say in what is necessary. This is a guilt-free way to pay for something that will not only benefit you, but will also signal to the government about your needs. </p><br/><p>After all, this is the mandatory part of your wage that you’re already spending. This makes the arduous process of doing taxes slightly less painful by incorporating some choice. It stops raising taxes always seem like a bad thing. This small incentive to contribute to the greater social good has the possibility to make people feel better about themselves, and feel involved in their communities, simply by paying their taxes.</p><br/></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/Posts/Voting/";window.___webpackCompilationHash="4a2de074e14fa8e810e4";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-a76dbd5d10c1a65604d6.js"],"app":["/app-5d2f379e1d2205877b7d.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-d2ef93456b40828a9040.js"],"component---src-pages-gridlock-js":["/component---src-pages-gridlock-js-37e5080a9e2967f3b9c4.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-f60de0755fd18ab18727.js"],"component---src-pages-nucleogenesis-js":["/component---src-pages-nucleogenesis-js-c3456d143fa1f79c08f4.js"],"component---src-pages-photogenesis-js":["/component---src-pages-photogenesis-js-50e9924677ce5a9cb36f.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-alien-tech-js":["/component---src-pages-posts-alien-tech-js-c0f86def7069e9cbf3d2.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-alientech-mdx":["/component---src-pages-posts-alientech-mdx-cdcc16867473141cd4b9.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-complexity-js":["/component---src-pages-posts-complexity-js-5d1d4e90386df8ca4d12.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-complexity-mdx":["/component---src-pages-posts-complexity-mdx-9b54564c316b8f6c0d3e.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-js":["/component---src-pages-posts-js-491955efe9243974c71a.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-os-gov-js":["/component---src-pages-posts-os-gov-js-1270dd26bc1733346986.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-osgov-mdx":["/component---src-pages-posts-osgov-mdx-771ca0b1cb7d7801e8a6.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-voting-js":["/component---src-pages-posts-voting-js-a7a0b86154be700b68a5.js"],"component---src-pages-posts-voting-mdx":["/component---src-pages-posts-voting-mdx-4c5c2f2ae73779047f8a.js"],"component---src-pages-streak-js":["/component---src-pages-streak-js-bfa0339875ac97454bf5.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/TestPortfolio/polyfill-a76dbd5d10c1a65604d6.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/TestPortfolio/component---src-pages-posts-voting-mdx-4c5c2f2ae73779047f8a.js" async=""></script><script src="/TestPortfolio/app-5d2f379e1d2205877b7d.js" async=""></script><script src="/TestPortfolio/framework-cfd576da017012f81ed3.js" async=""></script><script src="/TestPortfolio/webpack-runtime-1f79d37ca5720c8b1168.js" async=""></script></body></html>
