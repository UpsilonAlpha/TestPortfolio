I had this idea when the game 2048 started to skyrocket in popularity, however instead of using numbers I decided to put a more educational twist on the main mechanic.</p>\r\n        <p>The core logic of the game followed a simple algorithm. After each swipe the game went through each element in a 2D matrix using nested for loops, and checked the elements around it. The element had three options: fall, stop or merge. Once every element chose 'stop' then the event was over and the game listened for the next swipe.</p>\r\n        <p>In order to get the game to run smoothly I needed to seperate the logic from the animatons at the front-end. This required me to use asynchronous functions which awaited results from the algorithm in order to play the animation.</p>\r\n        <p>The game was based around a simple state machine that cycled through three states: falling, swiping and waiting. This prevented bugs that would arise from the user accidentally swiping the screen during an animation.</p>\r\n        <p>Finally I designed a UI with custom art and an unlockable system which rewarded players for progressing in the game while simultaneously educating them about stars!</p>\r\n        <p>This was one of my most valuable projects as it taught me so much about developing an app to production. I realized that while getting the basics of a game down was difficult, the majority of the time spent would be in the later stages, finding bugs and improving user experience.</p>\r\n        <p>However the success of this game led me to develop a second one! <Link style={linkStyles} to=\"/Photogenesis\">Photogenesis</Link>.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Nucleogenesis\r\n"],"names":["pageStyles","color","background","fontFamily","height","linkStyles","textDecoration","centerDiv","margin","padding","style","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
